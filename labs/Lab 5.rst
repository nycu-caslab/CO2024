Lab 5 : Implement Cache Manager
===============================

Introduction
------------

This lab you’ll design a cache manager to manage
the cache table and data in cache, also make sure your data is correct
in cache and memory.

We provide the code of cache simulator, but cache manager is empty, you
need to implement the cache manager to finish lab.

The implementation method of the cache manager has no restrictions, and
there are no specified block size requirements. As long as the cache
operates correctly, both **Direct Mapped** and **Set Associative Cache**
are acceptable. Additionally, you are free to design the **Cache
replacement policy** and **update policy** as you see fit.

Explain the code
----------------

.. code:: 

   class Cache
   {
   private:
       std::vector<Block> blocks;
       const unsigned int size;
       unsigned int len;
   public:
       Cache(unsigned int size);   
       
       unsigned int get_size();
       unsigned int get_len();
       unsigned int set_block_size(unsigned int block_size);
       unsigned int get_machine_address_bit();
       
       Block& operator[](unsigned int index);
   };

This is the Class of **Cache** we provide, you can use the
``get_size()`` get size of cache. ``get_len()`` get number of block.
``set_block_size(unsigned int block_size)`` set block size by yourself,
This configuration will be related to the number of cache lines.
``get_machine_address_bit()`` get machine address base.

--------------

.. code:: 

   class Block{
   private:
       std::vector<unsigned int> values;
   public:
       unsigned int len;
       unsigned int tag;
       
       Block(unsigned int block_size);

       unsigned int& operator[](unsigned int index);
   };

this is the Class of **Block** we provide, you must record the **Tag**
in ``Block.tag`` when the data in cache, and you also can use the
``Block.len`` get how many word(4 bytes) in a block

--------------

.. code:: 

   class CacheManager
   {
   private:
       Memory *memory;
       Cache *cache;
       unsigned int size;       // bytes
       unsigned int tag_bits;
   public:

       CacheManager(Memory *memory, Cache *cache);
       ~CacheManager();
       unsigned int read(unsigned int addr);
       void write(unsigned int addr, unsigned value);
   };

This is Class of **CacheManager**, you need to config your metadata in
Constructor (ex: block size, cache way…), and design your cache manager
read/write in cpp file. Test pattern will call the CacheManger
read/write to communicate with your cache, so this part you must manage
your data in cache and memory properly.

.. container:: info

   block size need to call Class Cache api
   ``set_block_size(unsigned int block_size)``

simple test case
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   w 80c9578 e79be23
   r bf880c18
   r 80c9578

.. container:: info

   You can use Python to program the pattern generator to
   generate the test case to verify your Cache Manager
