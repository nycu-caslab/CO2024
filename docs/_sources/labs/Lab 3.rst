Lab 3 : Simple Pipeline CPU
===========================

Introduction
------------

In Lab1 and Lab2, we finished the simple single-cycle CPU. We need to
make the CPU more efficient, so in Lab3, we will implement the
**5 stages pipeline cpu**. We don’t need to consider data hazards and control
hazards for now.

The pipeline registers module should be implemented by yourself; it
stores inter-staged signals at the posedge of the clock. Consider
parameter modules.

Lab Source Code
---------------

As for other modules, TAs think you should finish lab3 based on your
lab2 submission, so there is no template.

Instruction
-----------

Your CPU should be able to support the following RISC-V ISA.

- add, addi, sub, and, andi, or, ori 
- slt, slti 
- lw, sw

Requirement
-----------

-  implement pipeline register to store data of previous stage
-  Don’t need to consider data hazard or control hazard in this lab
-  Unlike Lab2, Lab3 needs to add a pipelining register in the datapath to store data of the previous stage

Submission
----------

Please submit your source code as a zip file to **E3**.

The name of the zip file should be .zip, and the structure of the file
should be as the following:

::

   <stduent_id>.zip
       |- <student_id>/
           |- ...(your source codes)

Hint
----

-  Read the textbook first and understand each submodule’s
   functionality.
-  Debugging with waveform makes your life easier.
-  Try to generate your risc-v machine code with Ripe; you can write a
   simple assembly to verify if your code runs as expected.
-  Write your assembly code and run it with Ripes to produce results, then
   verify and debug it with the waveform generated by your own pipeline CPU execution.
